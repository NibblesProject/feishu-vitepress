# CrystalDiskInfo_dll_lib

https://github.com/ftyszyx/CrystalDiskInfo_dll_lib

To obtain the correct disk name and serial number, the best approach is to use CrystalDiskInfo. However, CrystalDiskInfo is a Windows software written in C++. As a result, it cannot be directly used in one's own project. Therefore, I wrapped CrystalDiskInfo into a DLL. Now, other languages or Windows applications can also accurately distinguish the disk serial number with the help of CrystalDiskInfo. I have open-sourced this project on GitHub. If you are interested in it, you can check it out and use it.
